# Changelog

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-07

Major release consolidating ~6 weeks of work since 1.9.2: two new research engines (Semantic Scholar, Logically), deep-research structured output, configurable `all`-mode engines, ChatGPT and Gemini extractor rewrites that cut solo times from 71s → 8s, and full release/CI automation.

### Added

- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — automatic version → tag → GitHub release → npm publish, triggered by every push to master. Mirrors the pi-lens release pattern. Three jobs: `prepare` (detects new version via tag absence, verifies CHANGELOG entry, runs `npm publish --dry-run`), `release` (creates `vX.Y.Z` tag, pushes it, creates a GitHub release with auto-generated notes), `publish-npm` (runs `npm publish`, gated on `NPM_TOKEN` secret). The tag check is the sole release guard — no need to also require `package.json` in the diff, which breaks when the version bump and changelog land in separate commits.
- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — weekly npm dependency updates, grouped patch/minor, capped at 5 open PRs, labeled `dependencies` + `automated`.
- **Lint & lockfile CI gate** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/lint.mjs`, `scripts/check-lockfile.mjs`) — new `lint-and-lockfile` job that runs `npm run check:lockfile` (package.json ↔ package-lock.json sync) and `npm run lint` (cross-platform `node --check` on all 46 .mjs files) before any install. Both scripts are Node-only (no `find`/`grep`) so they work identically on Windows/macOS/Linux runners.
- **Tarball entry-point verification** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — CI now verifies every entry in `pi.extensions`, `pi.skills`, and `files` exists in the published tarball (not just `package.json`). Catches typos in the whitelist that would cause "module not found" at runtime.
- **Extension-load check** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — `npx jiti ./index.ts` smoke test on the globally-installed tarball that catches missing dependencies. The `pi-coding-agent` peer-dep absence is expected and ignored.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — new document with the extractor authoring guide (clipboard interception, single-eval stream wait, language-agnostic selectors, registration in two places, headless fast-fail, recovery engine list, docs to update), and recovery-policy notes. Links to AGENTS.md for architecture details.


### Added

- **Semantic Scholar extractor and PDF source fetching** (`extractors/semantic-scholar.mjs`, `src/search/pdf.mjs`, `src/search/fetch-source.mjs`, `src/search/sources.mjs`) — New no-API academic-paper discovery engine registered as `semantic-scholar` / `semanticscholar` / `s2`. It searches `semanticscholar.org`, extracts ranked paper cards, TLDRs, authors, venues, citation counts, Semantic Scholar paper URLs, and direct PDF/external links when available. GreedySearch source fetching now parses direct PDFs with lazy-loaded `pdf-parse` so deep research can feed actual paper text to Gemini instead of relying on the synthesizer to browse links itself. Academic sources are classified and counted as primary research evidence.

- **Logically extractor** (`extractors/logically.mjs`, `src/search/constants.mjs`, `bin/search.mjs`, `README.md`, `skills/greedy-search/skill.md`, `src/tools/greedy-search-handler.ts`) — New research engine for `logically.app/research-assistant` that submits a question through the ProseMirror editor, waits for the answer to stabilize, captures the rendered answer HTML, and opens the full `Citations (N)` popover to parse all Academic/Web citations. Academic cards provide citation counts, title, authors, venue, dates, fields, and snippets; Web URL blocks provide every cited URL occurrence. Inline answer citation popovers are still captured separately as `inlineSources`. Login/sign-up quota walls set `blockedBy: "signin"` / `verificationResult: "needs-human"`, participate in visible recovery, and visible tabs are activated before CDP typing so Logically accepts input reliably. Registered as `logically` / `log` in `ENGINES` and `logically` in `ENGINE_DOMAINS`. **Not in default `ALL_ENGINES`** — opt in via `~/.pi/greedyconfig` `engines` array.

- **Experimental Consensus extractor, unregistered/deprecated** (`extractors/consensus.mjs`, `extractors/common.mjs`, `bin/cdp.mjs`) — Prototype support for `consensus.app` remains in-tree for future fuller CSV/source-download work, but it is no longer registered as a supported engine because the free quota is too easy to exhaust. The prototype submits a research query, waits for prose, expands references, and intercepts the `Export → .CSV` menu's `/api/papers/details/` POST response for rich source metadata when available. All selectors are language-agnostic.

- **Browser-level CDP command (`browse`/`browserraw`)** (`bin/cdp.mjs`) — New CLI/daemon command for browser-target CDP methods (no `sessionId`). Adds `browserRawStr()` and forwards to the existing daemon socket. Needed for `Browser.setDownloadBehavior` and any future browser-level CDP method (permissions, geolocation, etc.). The evalraw path still works; browse is just the clean way to call browser-only methods.

- **Visible recovery diagnostics log** (`bin/search.mjs`, `src/search/constants.mjs`) — Headless → visible fallback attempts now append structured JSONL events to the temp-file log `greedysearch-visible-recovery.jsonl`. Entries include scope (`single`/`all`), phase (`start`/`success`/`needs-human`), affected engines, extractor envelopes, visible result mode, duration, and last stage, without logging the raw query text. ChatGPT now participates in the same visible-recovery policy on headless timeout/verification signals, and its wrapper budget is 80s so the extractor's 30s stream wait plus 35s fallback can finish cleanly.

### Fixed

- **ChatGPT extractor skipped the static homepage greeting card** (`extractors/chatgpt.mjs`) — chatgpt.com renders a pre-baked `[data-message-author-role="assistant"]` greeting ("Hello! How can I help you today?") with `data-turn-start-message="true"` on the homepage before any conversation happens. The old `waitForResponse` / `pollForResponseNodeSide` / `extractAnswerFromDom` all read `Array.from(...).at(-1)`, so when a typed query never produced a real response, the length check fired on the 32-char placeholder and the DOM fallback returned "Hello! How can I help you today?" as a successful answer. All three now find the assistant message that comes AFTER the last user message in DOM order, and `extractAnswer` throws a clear `blockedBy: "no-response"` error if no real response exists. Visible & headless smoke now return real ChatGPT answers (e.g. "Hello! 👋").
- **ChatGPT copy button clicked the user's message** (`extractors/chatgpt.mjs`) — `extractAnswer` used `document.querySelectorAll('${COPY_SELECTOR}')[buttons.length - 1]`, which picked the absolute last copy button on the page. When the assistant response was still empty (0 chars, no copy button of its own), that was the USER message's copy button — so the clipboard interceptor captured the user's query text and the extractor returned it as a "successful" answer (e.g. "What is the capital of France?" instead of "Paris"). Now the click targets the copy button on the assistant message after the last user message, with the old behaviour as a last-resort fallback.
- **ChatGPT stream wait was 65s for short answers** (`extractors/chatgpt.mjs`) — the two custom `waitForResponse` / `pollForResponseNodeSide` polls had a hardcoded 50-char `_minLen` (a safety margin for the static greeting card) and ran sequentially for 30s + 35s. A short answer like "Hello! 👋" (8 chars) never reached the threshold and burned the full 65s budget. Replaced with a single `waitForStreamComplete` call (the same shared helper Perplexity and Gemini use) with `minLength: 1` and a 20s timeout, plus a 15s node-side fallback for throttled `all`-mode tabs. Solo ChatGPT runs now complete in ~8s (down from 71s); warm `all`-mode runs in ~8s (down from 50s).

- **Research engine configuration and Consensus deprecation** (`src/search/constants.mjs`, `src/search/research.mjs`, `README.md`, `skills/greedy-search/skill.md`, `src/tools/greedy-search-handler.ts`) — Deep research child searches now explicitly follow the normal GreedySearch configuration pattern by reusing `~/.pi/greedyconfig.engines`, while Gemini remains the research planner/final-report synthesizer. Consensus is no longer registered in the engine map because it hits the free quota too easily; the extractor file remains in-tree for future fuller CSV/source-download work, but it is not exposed as a supported engine.

- **Logically full citations in headless mode** (`extractors/logically.mjs`) — The answer and inline citation popovers worked headless, but the full `Citations (N)` popover sometimes rendered without the visible-mode `All / Academic (N) / Web (N)` header and old inline citation popovers remained mounted. Full citation extraction now removes stale inline citation popovers before opening the full citations control, detects headerless card-list popovers, and falls back to the button's citation count when tab headers are absent. Headless smoke now captures the full citation list instead of falling back to inline sources only.

- **Consensus stale Clerk session recovery retained in prototype** (`extractors/consensus.mjs`) — The now-unregistered Consensus prototype still detects the broken Clerk handshake state (`clerk.consensus.app`, `session-token-expired`, `refresh_request_origin_azp_mismatch`, or Chrome's `HTTP ERROR 405` error page), clears only `https://consensus.app` and `https://clerk.consensus.app` storage, then retries navigation once. If re-enabled later, this avoids wiping the entire GreedySearch profile while recovering from corrupted Consensus auth cookies.

- **`getOrOpenTab` stealth race condition** (`extractors/common.mjs`) — The CDP daemon processes commands concurrently, not sequentially. `getOrOpenTab` was firing `injectHeadlessStealth` and immediately returning, racing the next `Page.navigate` from the extractor. The new document was created before the stealth `addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` registration landed, so headless fingerprinting (webdriver, UA client hints, hardware concurrency) fired on the new page and consensus.app bounced the request to a sign-up wall. Now `getOrOpenTab` awaits the stealth injection before returning the tab id. Comment in the code documents the race so the next person doesn't undo it.

- **`~/.pi/greedyconfig` unknown engines/synthesizers now warn** (`src/search/constants.mjs`) — When the user's config file referenced engine names that don't exist in `ENGINES` (typo, deprecated engine, or engine not yet shipped), the loader silently filtered them out. A user with `["perplexity", "bogus", "google"]` would get a 2-engine fan-out with no indication anything was wrong. Same for `synthesizer`: a typo would silently fall back to the default. Now both paths emit a stderr warning listing the unknown names, the available alternatives, and the resolved fallback when the config has no valid entries. The valid subset of a partially-bad config is still used as before; only the unknown names are dropped with a notice.

### Fixed

- **ChatGPT extraction under parallel load** (`extractors/chatgpt.mjs`, `bin/launch.mjs`, `src/search/engines.mjs`) — chatgpt-search was timing out at the orchestrator's 70s budget even when the response was actually rendered in the DOM. Three root causes, three fixes. (1) `waitForResponse` was waiting on the copy-button count as an indirect proxy — ChatGPT's React re-renders make that count fluctuate, so the "stable for 3 rounds" condition rarely fired. Rewritten to use the latest assistant message's `innerText.length` as the direct signal (text ≥50 chars stable for 3 rounds ≈ 2.4s of polling). (2) Chrome was clamping `setTimeout` to 1Hz in background tabs, so 4 parallel engines starved each other. Added `--disable-background-timer-throttling`, `--disable-renderer-backgrounding`, and `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows` to the GreedySearch Chrome launch flags. (3) The `stream-wait` budget was 60s — too long under any throttle and wasted the wrapper's timeout. Lowered to 30s with a 35s node-side fallback that releases the WebSocket between polls. Synth-mode tests now pass 83/83 with chatgpt-search consistently completing in ~12s.

- **Engine timeout diagnostic shadowing bug** (`src/search/engines.mjs`) — the `setTimeout` callback in `runExtractor` was shadowing the outer `err` string with `const err = new Error(...)`, then calling `tailLines(err)` on the next line with the Error object. That crashed with `TypeError: s.split is not a function` and lost the partial stderr capture. Renamed the new error to `errObj` and added `String(s ?? "")` to `tailLines` so it never throws on non-strings.

### Added

- **Research mode promoted to structured dataroom-style output** (`src/search/research.mjs`, `bin/search.mjs`, `src/tools/greedy-search-handler.ts`) — `depth: "research"` now writes a bundle by default under `.pi/greedysearch-research/<timestamp>_<query>/` with `STATUS.md`, `OUTLINE.md`, `reports/SUMMARY.md`, `reports/CLAIMS.md`, `reports/GAPS.md`, fetched `sources/`, and machine-readable `data/manifest.json` / `rounds.json` / `sources.json`. Added `--research-out-dir`, `--no-research-bundle`, and matching tool parameters `researchOutDir` / `writeResearchBundle`.

- **Research completion floor, question ledger, source evidence extraction, and citation audit metadata** (`src/search/research.mjs`, `src/formatters/results.ts`) — Research runs now maintain a STATUS-style open/closed question ledger, run goal-based evidence extraction over fetched sources, ask Gemini to mark answered questions and propose new ones, and compute deterministic floor checks around required/root question closure, fetched source count, primary-source coverage, quality score, structured claims, citations, and unfetched citations. Newly discovered follow-up questions remain visible handoff gaps instead of making every short run partial. The formatted tool result surfaces floor status, stop reason, evidence counts, question progress, and bundle path.

### Fixed

- **Bing Copilot login wall detection** (`extractors/bing-copilot.mjs`, `src/search/recovery.mjs`) — Copilot now gates the chat behind Microsoft/Apple/Google sign-in on fresh sessions. The extractor previously timed out waiting for `#userInput` and returned a confusing "input not found" error. Added `detectSignInWall()`: language-agnostic detection that checks whether the chat input is missing **and** the page contains links to known OAuth endpoints (`login.microsoftonline.com`, `appleid.apple.com`, `accounts.google.com`). Called before the 15s input wait and again on timeout fallback, so the error now reads "Copilot requires sign-in — please sign in with Microsoft, Apple, or Google in the visible browser window. Once signed in, cookies persist for future runs." Recovery patterns now include `sign.in|login required` so the runner surfaces `_needsHumanVerification` and keeps visible Chrome open for the user.

- **Gemini Material icon names changed** (`extractors/selectors.mjs`) — Google updated the icon data attributes in Gemini's UI: `content_copy` → `copy` and `send` → `arrow_upward`. The `.send-button` class was also removed. Updated selectors to match the new attributes so copy-button detection and message submission work again in both headless and visible modes.

- **Bing Copilot deprecated from default `all` fan-out** (`src/search/constants.mjs`, `src/tools/shared.ts`, `bin/search.mjs`, `src/tools/greedy-search-handler.ts`) — Copilot now requires Microsoft/Apple/Google sign-in on fresh sessions, causing frequent failures in multi-engine searches. Removed `"bing"` from `ALL_ENGINES`. The `engine: "all"` path now fans out to Perplexity and Google only. Bing Copilot remains available as an explicit single-engine option (`engine: "bing"`) for users who have signed in. Updated tool description, README, and skill docs to reflect the change.

- **ChatGPT extractor added** (`extractors/chatgpt.mjs`, `extractors/common.mjs`, `bin/search.mjs`) — New engine that navigates `chatgpt.com`, types into the ProseMirror editor, submits via the send button, and extracts answers + inline source citations via clipboard interception. ChatGPT copies markdown with reference-style links (`[text][1]` + `[1]: url "title"`), so `parseSourcesFromMarkdownRefStyle()` was added to `common.mjs`. The extractor uses a single `Runtime.evaluate` with in-browser polling for stream completion (matching Perplexity/Bing), avoiding CDP contention when running in parallel with other engines. Clipboard interception now captures text before attempting native clipboard writes, swallows native clipboard failures that caused misleading in-page "failed to copy" toasts, and falls back to language-agnostic assistant DOM extraction when clipboard capture is genuinely empty. Works in both headless and visible modes without requiring login. Registered as `chatgpt` / `gpt` in `ENGINES`.

- **Configurable `ALL_ENGINES` and synthesizer via `~/.pi/greedyconfig`** (`src/search/constants.mjs`, `src/search/synthesis-runner.mjs`) — Users can now customize which engines participate in the `"all"` fan-out by creating `~/.pi/greedyconfig` with `{ "engines": ["perplexity", "google", "chatgpt"], "synthesizer": "gemini" }`. The file is auto-created with the default set on first run. Optional all-search synthesis is now routed through an engine-agnostic synthesis runner with `gemini` as the default and `chatgpt` supported as an opt-in synthesizer. `src/tools/shared.ts` re-exports from constants.mjs instead of hardcoding, and the progress regex matches all known engines.

- **Research Gemini prompts no longer hit Windows `ENAMETOOLONG`** (`bin/cdp.mjs`, `extractors/common.mjs`, `extractors/gemini.mjs`) — Long research planning/learning prompts are now passed from the Gemini extractor to `cdp.mjs type` through stdin instead of command-line arguments.

- **Research starts Chrome in the intended mode before opening tabs** (`bin/search.mjs`) — `search.mjs` now establishes the headless/visible environment before `ensureChrome()`, preventing stale visible recovery browsers from making Gemini planning/synthesis appear visible on subsequent default-headless research runs.

- **Research direct-URL fetch actions work in ESM** (`src/search/research.mjs`) — Replaced a CommonJS `require("./sources.mjs")` in the direct `fetchUrl` path with normal ESM imports, avoiding runtime failures when Gemini plans a direct primary-source fetch.

- **Gemini synthesis no longer kills Chrome after opening its tab** (`src/search/browser-lifecycle.mjs`, `src/search/chrome.mjs`, `src/search/synthesis-runner.mjs`, `bin/search.mjs`) — Fixed two Chrome lifecycle regressions that produced `No target matching prefix` during multi-engine synthesis. Child-process stale-session cleanup now verifies GreedySearch Chrome command lines with path-separator-insensitive profile matching, so Windows backslash/forward-slash differences do not make a live Chrome look like a ghost process. Mode detection now prefers the live Chrome command line over the stale mode marker file, preventing visible-mode synthesis from killing visible Chrome immediately after opening the Gemini tab. Added unit coverage for both cases.
- **Gemini copy-button targeted `model-response` specifically** (`extractors/gemini.mjs`) — the absolute last copy button on the page is not always the assistant's response copy button (the page has many Material icon copy buttons: copy link, copy code, etc.). When the `model-response` custom element was empty, `extractAnswer` was clicking the wrong copy button and the clipboard interceptor captured the user's query — the extractor then returned the query as the answer. Now the click targets the copy button inside the `model-response` element, with a DOM fallback that reads `model-response` innerText (stripping the locale-specific "Gemini said" / "Το Gemini είπε" label) when the clipboard contains the echoed query.
- **SonarCloud dead `=== "true"` check dropped** (`extractors/gemini.mjs:152`) — the eval expression `(() => { ... })()` only ever returns a boolean (`false` when no `model-response` element, or `t.length > 20`), so `ready === "true"` was always false. Simplified to `if (ready === true)`. Resolves the SonarCloud MAJOR BUG flagged in the leak-period view.

### Documentation

- **AGENTS.md** updated to document the new release workflow (the `lint-and-lockfile` → `install-test` → `release` pipeline, NPM_TOKEN gating, manual `workflow_dispatch` override, versioning guidelines), the new engine notes for ChatGPT and Gemini (greeting-card skip, copy-button targeting, single-eval stream wait), the research-mode hardening details (ledger cap, academic fetch injection, social-source guardrail), and the updated extractor timeout budgets (ChatGPT 20s in-browser + 15s node-side).
- **README.md** cleaned up (split parameters section, removed anti-detection/known-quirks sections), and the **CHANGELOG** reformatted to use the new `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` heading convention that the release workflow's `grep -q "^## \[$VERSION\]"` check expects.

### Changed

- **Search modes simplified around grounded sources** (`bin/search.mjs`, `src/tools/greedy-search-handler.ts`, `README.md`, `skills/greedy-search/skill.md`) — `engine: "all"` is now the main grounded search mode: it fans out to configured engines, builds a source registry, fetches top source content, and returns confidence metadata by default. Synthesis is now an explicit opt-in via `synthesize: true` / `--synthesize` and uses the configured `synthesizer` (`gemini` default, `chatgpt` supported). Deep research remains a separate workflow via `depth: "research"`. Legacy `depth: "fast" | "standard" | "deep"` values remain accepted for compatibility (`fast` skips source fetching; `standard`/`deep` request synthesis) but are no longer the primary API.
- **Research-mode hardening** (`src/search/research.mjs`, `src/search/sources.mjs`) — three changes to improve deep-research output quality. (1) The open-question ledger is capped at `MAX_OPEN_FOLLOWUPS = 5` per round — overflow "Discovered gap/follow-up" questions auto-resolve with evidence rather than carrying forward, keeping the floor check (`computeResearchFloor.requiredQuestions`) meaningful. (2) `pickAcademicFetchTargets()` injects a `fetchUrl` action for the top 1-2 academic sources (`arxiv.org`, `semanticscholar.org`, `doi.org`) when `combinedSources` contains one and no round action is already a `fetchUrl` — forces PDF/academic text to actually be fetched and synthesized. (3) Social-source penalty increased from −12 to −20, plus a post-sort hard guardrail: sources are split into `nonSocial` and `socialSources`, each sorted independently, then concatenated `[...nonSocial, ...socialSources]` before the top-12 slice. A social source can no longer land as S1 even with high composite scores.
- **ChatGPT joined visible recovery** (`src/search/recovery.mjs`, `bin/search.mjs`) — the typed query can succeed in headless while the assistant response never streams in. Added ChatGPT to `HEADLESS_RECOVERY_ENGINES` so the same headless → visible fallback that helps Bing/Perplexity also fires on ChatGPT timeout/verification signals. The wrapper budget for ChatGPT was bumped to 80s so the extractor's 20s in-browser wait plus 15s node-side fallback can finish cleanly under the visible retry.

### Removed

## [1.9.2] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Iterative research mode** (`bin/search.mjs`, `src/search/research.mjs`) — Added `--research` / `--depth research` and `greedy_search({ depth: "research" })`. The new mode plans focused follow-up queries, runs fast multi-engine searches, fetches and deduplicates sources, extracts compact learnings/gaps with Gemini, and writes a final cited report. Optional knobs: `breadth` (1-5), `iterations` (1-3), and `maxSources` (3-12). Research mode now fills under-planned breadth with deterministic fallback query angles so `breadth: 3` actually fans out even when Gemini is conservative.

### Fixed

- **Pi update dependency install is leaner** (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`) — Moved the direct `@sinclair/typebox` import into runtime dependencies and marked the Pi host peer as optional so npm does not auto-install a full nested `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` tree during git-package updates. This keeps `pi update` focused on GreedySearch runtime deps (`jsdom`, `@mozilla/readability`, `turndown`) and avoids partial installs that leave `jsdom/package.json` missing.

- **Pi TUI peer import no longer required at load time** (`src/tools/greedy-search-handler.ts`) — Replaced the direct `@earendil-works/pi-tui` runtime import with a tiny local `Text` component implementation so Pi/jiti extension import works even when optional TUI peer packages are not installed locally.

- **Research unit tests no longer require fetcher dependencies at import time** (`src/search/research.mjs`) — Research mode now lazy-loads source fetching/file-output helpers only during live research execution, keeping pure planning/normalization unit tests runnable in CI's tarball install simulation without local `node_modules`.

- **Research query sanitizer avoids ReDoS hotspot** (`src/search/research.mjs`) — Replaced markdown-link cleanup regexes with bounded string scanning and manual whitespace collapse, resolving the SonarCloud super-linear regex hotspot while preserving `site:[label](url)` query cleanup.

- **Research source quality cleanup** (`src/search/sources.mjs`, `src/search/research.mjs`) — Social/login-wall domains (`facebook.com`, `linkedin.com`, `x.com`, etc.) now receive a strong ranking penalty unless the query explicitly targets that platform. Research source dedupe now uses the same composite score as normal source ranking, per-round learning extraction errors are recorded in `_research.rounds[].learningError`, child-search stderr forwarding is filtered so noisy page CSS/HTML cannot flood research logs, and markdown links in Gemini-generated follow-up queries are sanitized before search.

- **Bing headless stealth hardening** (`extractors/common.mjs`, `bin/launch.mjs`) — Adopted low-risk ideas from Obscura's stealth model: `navigator.webdriver` now resolves to `undefined` instead of `false`, navigator plugins/mimeTypes/mediaDevices/connection/pdfViewer/platform/vendor are made more Chrome-like, patched functions stringify as `[native code]`, canvas noise is stable per page instead of random on each call, and Chrome launches with `--lang=en-US` plus `--force-color-profile=srgb`. Live Bing headless smoke passed after the change without visible recovery.

- **Research/Bing false recovery fixed** (`bin/search.mjs`, `extractors/bing-copilot.mjs`, `extractors/consent.mjs`) — Research child searches no longer mark Bing/Perplexity failed before visible recovery has a final status, Bing fast-mode keeps a bounded 40s parent budget, and Bing's short-mode stream wait caps at 25s so research can extract rendered partial answers before timing out. Bing verification detection now reuses the DOM-based `handleVerification` detector instead of scanning accessibility text for generic words like “Cloudflare” or “challenge”, preventing false visible-recovery trips when the user query/answer is about anti-bot systems. Added locale-agnostic DOM/accessibility fallback extraction that picks the assistant article without relying solely on English “Copilot said” labels.

## [1.9.1] — 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Visible Chrome launches minimized** (`bin/launch-visible.mjs`) — After Chrome's CDP endpoint becomes ready, `minimizeViaCDP` sends `Browser.setWindowBounds { windowState: "minimized" }` via the browser-level WebSocket. Chrome lands in the taskbar immediately instead of stealing focus from the user's active window. Closes [#20](https://github.com/apmantza/GreedySearch-pi/issues/20).

- **Recovery path always returns to headless** (`bin/search.mjs`) — After a visible-mode retry (triggered by Cloudflare blocking headless), the pipeline now unconditionally kills visible Chrome and relaunches headless before running Gemini synthesis. Previously the switch-back only happened when zero engines were recovered (`recovered === 0`), so a partial recovery left visible Chrome alive and caused synthesis to open the Gemini tab in the visible window.

- **ReDoS hotspots fixed** (`bin/launch.mjs`, `extractors/selectors.mjs`, `src/fetcher.mjs`, `src/search/sources.mjs`) — Four SonarCloud `javasecurity:S5852` hotspots resolved: (1) Chrome version directory regex bounded (`\d+` → `\d{1,10}` ×4 groups); (2) Perplexity citation name regex bounded (`\s+` → `\s{1,20}`, `[^.]+` → `[^.]{1,200}`); (3) seven suspicious-content regex patterns in `checkContentQuality` replaced with `String.includes` checks (faster and immune to backtracking on adversarial input); (4) trailing-slash removal regex bounded (`\/+$` → `\/{1,10}$`). Follow-up: string checks lowercased via a single `markdown.toLowerCase()` call to restore the case-insensitive matching the original regexes provided.

- **Collapsed tool rendering: consensus label fixed** (`src/tools/greedy-search-handler.ts`) — The collapsed summary was reading `synthesis.consensus` which does not exist in the schema; the field is `synthesis.agreement.level`. Collapsed view now correctly shows e.g. `→ Synthesized · 5 sources · high`.

- **`minimizeViaCDP` guard inverted in `launch.mjs`** (`bin/launch.mjs`) — The early-return guard was `if (isVisible()) return` which caused the function to exit immediately in the only case it was ever called (visible Chrome launch via `GREEDY_SEARCH_VISIBLE=1`). Changed to `if (isHeadless()) return`. Also removed the unnecessary 1s sleep (Chrome is already confirmed ready via `writePortFile()` before this is called) and applied the SonarCloud S8480 fix (`wsPath` extracted from `webSocketDebuggerUrl`, WebSocket URL reconstructed as `ws://localhost:${PORT}${wsPath}`).

- **Gemini tab no longer steals focus during synthesis** (`bin/search.mjs`) — Removed the `activateTab` call on the pre-navigated Gemini tab. `Target.activateTarget` was restoring the minimized Chrome window mid-search; CDP synthesis operates on the target ID directly and has no need for the tab to be Chrome's active tab.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Query normalization** (`src/search/query.mjs`, new) — Two universal transforms applied before every search, zero latency overhead:
  - **Preamble stripping**: removes agent-generated openers ("can you explain", "I need to know about", "tell me", etc.) that add noise without search signal. "Can you explain how the Rust borrow checker works?" → "how the Rust borrow checker works?"
  - **Recency anchoring**: appends the current year when the query contains explicit temporal language (`latest`, `current`, `recent`, `up-to-date`) but no version number or year is already present. "latest FastAPI best practices" → "latest FastAPI best practices 2026". Skipped when a version number like `3.13` or a year like `2024` is already in the query. No Google-specific keyword conversion — all three engines use AI modes that handle natural-language questions natively.

### Changed

- **Source ranking: composite score replaces cascading tiebreakers** (`src/search/sources.mjs`) — All ranking signals (query-domain boost, engine consensus, source type, best rank) now contribute simultaneously via a weighted formula: `smartScore×3 + engineCount×5 + sourceTypePriority×2 + max(0,7−rank)`. Previously rank was only a quaternary tiebreaker and was ignored whenever engines disagreed on a source — a site ranked #1 by one engine could lose to a site ranked #8 by two engines. Now rank is always a real signal.

- **Community penalty refined** (`src/search/sources.mjs`) — Discussion forums (Reddit, HN, Lobsters) now get a stronger penalty (−3) when preferred official domains exist. Q&A sites (StackOverflow, StackExchange) are explicitly excluded from any penalty — a top SO answer is often the best practical reference. Community blogs (Medium, Dev.to) get a mild −1 instead of the flat −2 that treated them identically to Reddit.

- **Synthesis prompt: structured JSON output + source snippets** (`src/search/synthesis.mjs`) — Prompt now explicitly requests JSON output wrapped in `BEGIN_JSON`/`END_JSON` markers with a concrete schema (`answer`, `agreement`, `differences`, `caveats`, `recommendedSources`). Previously the prompt asked for "a brief answer and key points", so `parseStructuredJson` always returned null and `agreement`, `differences`, `caveats`, `recommendedSources` were dead code on every search. Now all structured fields are populated. Source snippets (300 chars in standard mode, 700 in grounded) are always included in the source registry — previously only grounded mode got them — so Gemini can make citation decisions based on actual content rather than just domain metadata.

- **Gemini tab pre-navigated in parallel with source fetch** (`bin/search.mjs`, `extractors/gemini.mjs`) — In `all` mode, a Gemini tab is now opened and navigated to `gemini.google.com/app` concurrently with source fetching instead of sequentially after it. `gemini.mjs` skips the navigation if the tab is already on the Gemini domain (same pattern as Bing/Perplexity). Saves ~4s off synthesis start on every standard-depth `all` search.

- **Source fetch concurrency 4→5** (`src/search/constants.mjs`) — Default `SOURCE_FETCH_CONCURRENCY` increased from 4 to 5. With 5 top sources fetched per search, this runs all fetches in a single parallel batch instead of 4+1 sequential batches. Saves ~1s when any source in the first batch is slow (browser-fetched sources can take 3-4s each). Still overridable via `GREEDY_FETCH_CONCURRENCY` env var.

- **Bing copy-button wait 5s→2s** (`extractors/bing-copilot.mjs`) — `waitForCopyButton` timeout reduced from 5s to 2s. The Cloudflare snap check at the top of `extractAnswer` guarantees we only reach this point on a clean response, where the copy button appears within ~1s of stream completion. Saves up to 3s per Bing call.

### Fixed

- **Gemini lands in wrong frame context** (`bin/cdp.mjs`) — `captureMainContext` picked the first `isDefault` execution context after `Runtime.enable`, which for Gemini was the empty `_/bscframe` child iframe rather than the `app` main frame. All evals were running against an empty document, so `rich-textarea .ql-editor` was never found. Fixed by fetching the root frame ID from `Page.getFrameTree` and preferring the context whose `auxData.frameId` matches. Falls back to the old behaviour for sites with a single context. Fixes Gemini extraction on first cold start.

- **Bing Copilot CF headless fast-fail** (`extractors/bing-copilot.mjs`) — Cloudflare blocks the Copilot response iframe *after* query submission, not during navigation, so the extractor wasted ~18s polling the clipboard before `extractFromIframes` finally detected the challenge. Added an accessibility-tree snap check at the top of `extractAnswer` in headless mode that fast-fails immediately when a CF challenge is present. Headless failure time: ~27s → ~6s.

- **Perplexity Cloudflare headless detection** (`extractors/perplexity.mjs`) — Perplexity is CF-protected in headless just like Bing. Added the same early snap check before the input selector wait. Also added the post-verification settle + re-navigation block (matching Bing's flow) so the page has time to redirect from the CF challenge page to the real homepage before the input is searched for. Input `waitForSelector` timeout increased 5s → 15s to cover CF redirect + React hydration time. Added an explicit `!inputReady` throw instead of falling through to a confusing `cdp click` failure.

- **False-positive verification clicks at (0, 0)** (`extractors/consent.mjs`) — On Cloudflare challenge pages (Perplexity, Copilot), `VERIFY_DETECT_JS` matched hidden/unmounted elements whose `getBoundingClientRect` returned a zero rect. `humanClickElement` now skips elements with zero dimensions or (0, 0) center. `tryHumanClick` skips `{t:'xy'}` payloads with both coordinates at zero. Prevents clicks that "succeeded" but hit the wrong place and left the challenge loop believing it had cleared.

- **CF cookie persistence across Chrome restarts** (`src/search/chrome.mjs`) — Chrome was killed with `taskkill /F` (force-kill) before it could flush its SQLite cookie database, so `cf_clearance` cookies earned during visible recovery were lost on the next headless run. `killChrome` now sends `Browser.close` via the browser-level CDP WebSocket first, waits up to 1.5s for Chrome to exit gracefully (flushing cookies), then falls back to force-kill if still running. After a single human-solved Turnstile, subsequent headless runs reuse the cached cookie and skip the challenge entirely.

- **Browser-level OOPIF click for Turnstile** (`extractors/consent.mjs`) — Cloudflare Turnstile renders in a cross-origin OOPIF (`challenges.cloudflare.com`). Page-session `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` doesn't route into OOPIFs. `humanClickXY` now additionally fires the same click sequence via the browser-level CDP WebSocket (`/json/version` → `webSocketDebuggerUrl`), which routes through the top-level compositor and reaches the OOPIF — without attaching to the target (which would poison it). The page-level click is kept for regular elements; the browser-level click is a best-effort addition that never throws.

### Removed

- **`googlesearch` / `gs` engine** — Removed the `google-search` extractor (`extractors/google-search.mjs`) and its `googlesearch`/`gs` engine aliases from `ENGINES` in `constants.mjs`. The classic Google Search extractor was broken in headless mode and not part of the `"all"` fan-out.
- **`pplx` and `copilot` aliases** — Removed redundant engine aliases from `ENGINES` in `constants.mjs`. `pplx` was a longer alias for `perplexity` (shorter `p` exists) and `copilot` was an alias for `bing` (shorter `b` exists). Neither was documented in the tool schema or skill.

## [1.8.10] — 2026-05-11

### Removed

- **Dead `bing-aria` extractor** (`extractors/bing-aria.mjs`) — Removed the unused ARIA-tree-based Bing Copilot extractor and its `bing2` engine alias. Nothing in the system referenced it (`bing2` was not in `ALL_ENGINES`, not documented in the tool schema, and had no callers).

### Fixed

- **Perplexity sign-in mis-click** (`extractors/consent.mjs`) — `handleVerification` matched any button containing "continue", including "Continue with Google" OAuth buttons on Perplexity sign-in modals. This caused the automation to accidentally open Google/Microsoft login flows. Added explicit exclusions for `sign.in`, `log.in`, `google`, `microsoft`, `apple`, `facebook`, `github`, and `auth` text patterns in both `VERIFY_DETECT_JS` and `VERIFY_RETRY_JS`.

- **Gemini synthesis typing failure** (`extractors/gemini.mjs`) — `document.execCommand('insertText')` silently failed for long synthesis prompts (~8-10k chars), causing the extractor to submit an empty input and wait forever (45s stream + 180s timeout). Replaced with CDP `Input.insertText` + explicit focus click + content-length verification. Now fails fast with a clear error if text doesn't land.

- **Gemini answer extraction — query echo** (`extractors/gemini.mjs`) — When the assistant response copy button hadn't hydrated yet, clicking `buttons[buttons.length - 1]` hit the user's message copy button instead of Gemini's response, returning the query text as the "answer". Added wait for the assistant copy button to appear (2+ buttons on page), plus retry logic that detects exact query-text echo and re-clicks after a settle delay.

- **Bing Copilot Cloudflare auto-bypass** (`extractors/consent.mjs`) — Copilot's Turnstile challenge lives inside a **closed shadow DOM**, invisible to `document.querySelector('iframe')`. Added detection for the queryable host container (`#cf-turnstile`) and hidden response input (`[id^="cf-chl-widget-"]`), returning center coordinates for `humanClickXY`. During visible recovery, the challenge now auto-clicks and resolves transparently.

## [1.8.9] — 2026-05-11

### Changed

- **Halved Gemini synthesis timeout** (`extractors/gemini.mjs`) — `waitForStreamComplete` timeout reduced from 90s to 45s. Gemini synthesis prompts are ~8-10k chars and typically respond in 15-30s. The extra 45s was pure dead time.
- **Aligned Gemini extractor hard timeout** (`src/search/engines.mjs`) — reduced from 120s to 70s, matching the new 45s stream wait + ~25s nav/settle overhead.

### Fixed

- **Perplexity/Bing visible recovery now actually stores cookies** (`bin/search.mjs`) — Two issues fixed:
  1. **Second visible retry**: The first visible retry resolves Cloudflare/Turnstile (navigating through the challenge which breaks the CDP session with "Inspected target navigated or closed"), but the search never ran. A second retry on the same tab now reuses the freshly-cached Turnstile cookies and executes the actual search.
  2. **Keep Chrome alive on recovery success**: Previously Chrome was killed with `taskkill /F` after recovery, losing any pending cookie database writes. Now visible Chrome stays running when recovery succeeds (or needs human intervention), keeping the cookie session alive.
- **Visible Chrome window minimized after recovery** (`bin/search.mjs`) — When visible Chrome is left open after recovery (for cookie persistence or user verification), the window is automatically minimized so it doesn't clutter the desktop.

## [1.8.8] — 2026-05-09

### Added

- **`/set-greedy-locale` Pi command** (`index.ts`) — Set default locale for search results (e.g., `/set-greedy-locale de`, `/set-greedy-locale --clear`, `/set-greedy-locale --show`). Saves to `~/.config/greedysearch/config.json`.
- **Browser lifecycle defense patterns** (`src/search/browser-lifecycle.mjs`, new) — Centralized lifecycle management adopted from open-websearch's robust cross-process browser patterns:
  - **Structured JSON metadata** (`greedysearch-chrome-metadata.json`) replaces three scattered text files (PID, mode, activity) with a single file tracking `browserPid`, `debugPort`, `tempDir`, `clientPids[]`, `sessionMode`, `lastActivity`, `launchedAt`. Backward-compatible — legacy files still written.
  - **Process command-line verification** — `verifyBrowserProcess()` checks not just PID alive but that the process command line contains the profile dir and debug port. Prevents PID collision false-positives where a different process reuses the same PID.
  - **Cross-process launch lock** — `acquireLaunchLock()` uses exclusive-create (`wx` flag) to prevent concurrent `ensureChrome()` calls from racing to launch Chrome. Stale lock recovery after 15s.
  - **Stale session cleanup** — `cleanupStaleSessions()` runs once per process on first `ensureChrome()`. Scans metadata for dead PIDs, verifies survivors via command line, force-kills orphans, reclaims ghost processes on port 9222.
  - **Client PID tracking** — `registerClient`/`unregisterClient` track which processes share the Chrome instance.
- **Mode-specific idle timeouts** (`src/search/chrome.mjs`) — Headless Chrome keeps the aggressive 5-minute idle timeout (`GREEDY_SEARCH_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`) since it's cheap to restart. Visible Chrome (explicitly launched for captcha/cookie setup) gets a 60-minute grace period (`GREEDY_SEARCH_VISIBLE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`) to avoid wasting the user's captcha investment. Set either to 0 to disable for that mode.

### Added

- **System command path resolution** (`src/utils/system-cmds.mjs`, new) — `resolveSystemCmd()` resolves `powershell`, `netstat`, `taskkill`, `ps`, `lsof`, `ss`, `grep` to absolute paths for secure execution. `isPathSafe()` validates PATH environment variable composition. Satisfies SonarCloud security hotspot requirements for `execFileSync`/`execSync` PATH safety.

### Fixed

- **SonarCloud security hotspots — 15 resolved** — Addressed all flagged items:
  - **11 ReDoS-prone regex patterns**: Replaced greedy `.{0,50}` in fetcher's content quality check with lazy quantifier `.{0,50}?`; replaced alternation-heavy split regex in bing-copilot with `[^\S\n]*` horizontal whitespace; replaced `[\s\S]*` JSON extraction patterns in synthesis.mjs with `indexOf`/`lastIndexOf` brace matching; replaced `.+?\.` in selectors with `[^.]+`; replaced `\s+\S*$` trim patterns in sources.mjs, common.mjs, and content.mjs with `lastIndexOf` word-boundary detection; replaced markdown link regex in common.mjs with O(n) indexOf-based parser.
  - **4 PATH-injection hotspots in browser-lifecycle.mjs and chrome.mjs**: Created `resolveSystemCmd()` utility returning absolute paths for `powershell.exe`, `netstat.exe`, `taskkill.exe` (Windows) and `/usr/bin/ps`, `/usr/bin/lsof`, `/usr/sbin/ss`, `/usr/bin/grep` (Unix). Replaced all bare command names in `execFileSync`/`execSync` calls.

- **SonarCloud minor vulnerability false positives** — Confirmed both remaining issues are false positives (internal diagnostic logging in `bin/gschrome.mjs` and test debug output in `test/fetcher-cli.mjs`). Verified via full smoke test suite: all 33 unit tests pass, all 4 engines (Perplexity, Bing, Google, Gemini) return results at all depths (fast/standard/deep), CDP safety wrappers correctly enforce mode boundaries.

- **SonarCloud security hotspots** (re-verified) — All previously fixed hotspots remain resolved: replaced `spawn("node", ...)` with `spawn(process.execPath, ...)`, replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomInt()`, 19 remaining hotspots confirmed as false positives (hardcoded `execSync` commands, simple regex patterns).

### Fixed

- **Headless→visible mode switching** (`src/search/chrome.mjs`) — `ensureChrome()` only handled the case where visible was requested but headless Chrome was running. When headless was requested (the default) but visible Chrome was running, it silently kept visible mode — causing env var mismatches that broke extractors like Perplexity. Now properly detects both directions and kills/relaunches in the correct mode.

- **SonarCloud security hotspots** — Replaced `spawn("node", ...)` with `spawn(process.execPath, ...)` in cdp wrapper, `runExtractor`, `synthesizeWithGemini`, and test helper to prevent PATH-based binary substitution. Replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomInt()` in `jitter()` for non-security-sensitive timing variance. Remaining 19 hotspots are verified false positives (hardcoded `execSync` commands, simple regex patterns).
- **Bing stealth not active on page load** (`src/search/chrome.mjs`) — `injectHeadlessStealth` was fire-and-forget (`.catch(() => {})`). The CDP `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` command is async — extractors often navigated to Copilot before stealth registered. Cloudflare saw headless fingerprints and blocked the page. Fixed by awaiting stealth for Bing tabs. Perplexity/Google kept fire-and-forget since Perplexity's anti-bot detects the awaited patches.
- **Bing copy button handler not hydrated** (`extractors/bing-copilot.mjs`) — Copilot's React copy button exists in the DOM before its click handler is bound. `clickCopyAndPollClipboard` clicked too early → clipboard interceptor empty → 13s wasted polling + DOM fallback. Added 800ms hydration delay after `waitForCopyButton`. Solo Bing went from 37-73s → 16s.
- **Manual verification blocked synthesis** (`bin/search.mjs`) — When Bing/Perplexity needed manual verification after visible recovery, `search.mjs` returned early with `synthesize: false`, discarding all engine results. Now synthesis continues with whichever engines succeeded. Visible Chrome stays open for the user.
- **Source-fetch crash after visible→headless recovery** (`src/search/fetch-source.mjs`) — After recovery killed/restarted Chrome, stale CDP tab references in parallel source-fetch workers caused "No target matching prefix" crashes. Workers now catch `fetchSourceContent` errors; `fetchSourceContentBrowser` returns error objects instead of throwing.
- **Progress tracker "🔄 synthesizing" hang** (`src/tools/shared.ts`) — When synthesis was skipped (manual verification), the progress tracker showed "🔄 synthesizing" forever because no `PROGRESS:synthesis:done` was ever emitted. Now handles `done`/`error`/`skipped` synthesis states.
- **Gemini synthesis eval timeout** (`bin/cdp.mjs`) — CDP daemon `TIMEOUT` was 30s, but `waitForStreamComplete` uses a single `Runtime.evaluate` call that can run 60-90s for long synthesis prompts. Increased to 90s.

### Performance

- **Reduced timeouts across all extractors** — Navigation: 35s→20s, verification retry: 30s→10s (Bing/Perplexity), 60s→10s (Gemini/Google), post-nav settle: 1200ms→600ms (Bing), 1200ms→600ms (Gemini). Turnstile never clears in headless, so 30s of retry loops were pure waste.
- **Hard per-engine timeouts raised** (`bin/search.mjs`) — Fast: 22s→30s, Standard/Deep: 35s→55s. CDP contention from 3 parallel extractors adds overhead that the old budgets didn't account for.
- **Tab creation split: Bing gets blank+stealth, others pre-seeded** (`src/search/chrome.mjs`) — `Target.createTarget` navigation is less detectable than CDP `Page.navigate` for Perplexity/Google. Bing needs blank tab + awaited stealth to hide headless fingerprints from Copilot's Cloudflare.

### Performance

- **Hard per-engine timeouts** (`bin/search.mjs`) — Fast mode: 22s per engine. Standard/deep: 35s per engine. Slow engines are skipped instead of stalling the whole batch. Previously a single slow engine could push `all` searches to 60–90s.
- **Parallel tab creation** (`bin/search.mjs`, `src/search/chrome.mjs`) — All engine tabs open simultaneously instead of sequential 300ms staggered delays. Tabs are pre-seeded to each engine's homepage so extractors skip redundant initial navigation.
- **Reduced settle delays** (`extractors/common.mjs`) — `postNav` 1500→800ms, `postNavSlow` 2000→1200ms, `postClick`/`postType` 400→300ms, `afterVerify` 3000→1500ms. Safe because tabs now load the target domain before the extractor even starts.
- **Higher source-fetch concurrency** (`src/search/constants.mjs`) — Default `GREEDY_FETCH_CONCURRENCY` raised from 2 → 4.
- **Faster HTTP timeouts** (`src/search/fetch-source.mjs`) — HTTP fetch timeout 15s → 10s, browser fallback settle 1500ms → 800ms.
- **Non-blocking cleanup** (`bin/search.mjs`) — Removed the 1500ms hard sleep at process exit; `minimizeChrome` now fire-and-forget.
- **Domain-aware navigation skip** (`extractors/bing-copilot.mjs`, `extractors/perplexity.mjs`, `extractors/google-ai.mjs`) — When a tab is already on the engine's domain (pre-seeded by orchestrator), skip the redundant `cdp nav` call and settle delay.
- **Fast mode keeps short engine budgets** (`bin/search.mjs`) — Fast mode still uses 22s per-engine extraction timeouts and skips source fetch/synthesis work. Verification recovery can now run in fast mode when Bing/Perplexity are blocked, because returning no result is worse than the retry cost.

### Anti-Bot Detection Hardening (Anti-CDP Evasion)

- **Runtime.enable evasion** (`bin/cdp.mjs`) — The primary CDP detection vector (Cloudflare/DataDome watch for `Runtime.consoleAPICalled` timing) has been eliminated. All `Runtime.evaluate` calls now use an explicit `contextId` captured via brief `Runtime.enable` → `Runtime.disable` at daemon startup (~100ms window). No persistent Runtime domain enable for the session. See: rebrowser.net / DataDome research.
- **Stale PID / ghost Chrome cleanup** (`src/search/chrome.mjs`) — `killChrome()` now uses port-based process detection via `netstat`/`lsof` instead of relying solely on the PID file. Handles ghost processes that hold port 9222 after the tracked PID dies. Old `killHeadlessChrome` kept as backward-compat alias.
- **Idle cleanup for both modes** (`src/search/chrome.mjs`) — `checkAndKillIdle()` no longer gates on `GREEDY_SEARCH_HEADLESS=1`. Both headless and visible Chrome auto-kill after idle timeout. Disable with `GREEDY_SEARCH_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=0`.
- **`--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` for visible mode** (`bin/launch.mjs`, `bin/gschrome.mjs`) — Previously headless-only. The flag and `--window-size` now apply to both modes, suppressing `navigator.webdriver` in visible Chrome too.
- **Stealth injection for visible mode** (`src/search/chrome.mjs`, `extractors/common.mjs`) — Canvas noise, plugin spoofing, `window.chrome.runtime`, and console safening now inject on both headless and visible tabs.
- **Client Hints consistency** (`src/fetcher.mjs`) — Added `Sec-CH-UA`, `Sec-CH-UA-Mobile`, `Sec-CH-UA-Platform` headers to `DEFAULT_HEADERS`, matching the Chrome 122 user-agent. Inconsistency between UA and Client Hints is a strong bot signal.
- **Perplexity Cloudflare verification** (`extractors/perplexity.mjs`) — Added `handleVerification` call after navigation. Perplexity was the only engine missing Cloudflare challenge handling (Bing, Gemini, Google AI already had it).
- **Chrome TLS fetch fallback** (`src/search/fetch-source.mjs`) — New `fetchSourceViaChrome()` uses `Network.loadNetworkResource` (Chrome 124+) to fetch with authentic Chrome TLS/JA3+HTTP/2 fingerprints when Node.js HTTP fails. Zero navigation overhead.

### Added

- **`visible` / `alwaysVisible` search options** (`src/tools/greedy-search-handler.ts`, `src/tools/shared.ts`, `bin/search.mjs`) — Agents can now force visible Chrome per call with `visible: true`, `alwaysVisible: true`, or `headless: false`. CLI aliases: `--visible`, `--always-visible`. Global env: `GREEDY_SEARCH_ALWAYS_VISIBLE=1`.
- **GreedySearch Chrome commands for Pi** (`index.ts`) — Added `/greedy-visible`, `/greedy-status`, and `/greedy-kill` so users do not need to know package install paths to manage the dedicated Chrome instance.
- **Safe CDP wrappers** (`bin/cdp-greedy.mjs`, `bin/cdp-visible.mjs`, `bin/cdp-headless.mjs`) — Agents can inspect only the dedicated GreedySearch Chrome profile. The wrappers always set `CDP_PROFILE_DIR` and mode-specific wrappers refuse to attach to the wrong mode, preventing accidental main-Chrome pollution.
- **`bin/kill-visible.mjs`** — Strong visible/port cleanup helper backed by `launch-visible.mjs`'s PID + port nuke path.
- **`bin/gschrome.mjs`** — Standalone Chrome lifecycle manager: `launch-headless`, `launch-visible`, `kill`, `status`. Port-based PID detection, forces mode switches, writes `DevToolsActivePort` for CDP.

### Fixed

- **Single-engine visible recovery** (`bin/search.mjs`) — `engine: "bing"` and `engine: "perplexity"` now perform the same headless → visible retry as `engine: "all"` when blocked by Cloudflare, captcha, timeout, missing input, or clipboard failures.
- **Bing visible clipboard race** (`extractors/bing-copilot.mjs`) — Waits for the assistant copy button, polls clipboard interception after click, retries copy/poll, then falls back to visible DOM text. Fixes cases where Copilot visibly answered but the extractor returned `Clipboard interceptor returned empty text`.
- **Manual verification flow** (`bin/search.mjs`, `src/formatters/results.ts`) — If visible retry reaches a human verification challenge, GreedySearch leaves visible Chrome open and returns a clear “solve verification, then rerun” result instead of killing the browser and returning no results.
- **Visible/headless process cleanup** (`bin/launch.mjs`, `bin/visible.mjs`) — Fixed Windows `taskkill` arguments, added port fallback cleanup for `--kill`, and made `visible.mjs --kill` delegate to the stronger `launch-visible.mjs` cleanup path.
- **README install paths and skill guidance** (`README.md`, `skills/greedy-search/skill.md`) — Corrected Pi git/npm package paths, documented visible mode and safe CDP wrappers, and removed stale `coding_task` guidance from the agent skill.

## [1.8.6] — 2026-05-04

### Bing Copilot: Headless Cloudflare Recovery

- **Auto-retry triggers on all Bing failures** — Error pattern expanded from `input not found|verification` to include `clipboard` failures, so any extraction failure triggers the visible Chrome recovery.
- **Clipboard retry** — `bing-copilot.mjs` now retries clipboard extraction once with a 2s delay, matching the Perplexity extractor pattern.
- **Cloudflare detection** — If the clipboard is empty and the AI copy button is hidden, the extractor checks the accessibility tree for Cloudflare challenge text and logs it explicitly for faster diagnosis.
- **DOM extraction fallback** — If clipboard fails and the copy button is missing (headless anti-bot behavior), attempts direct text extraction from the `copilot.fun` → blob: iframe chain via CDP targets. Falls through to the visible auto-retry if Cloudflare blocks the iframe.
- **Investigation confirmed** — In headless mode, Copilot renders the AI response inside a `copilot.fun` → blob: iframe sandbox with a Cloudflare Turnstile challenge. The `copy-ai-message-button` (`data-testid`) is hidden. Content is unreachable from both the main frame JS (cross-origin) and CDP iframe traversal (Cloudflare blocks load). The only viable path is visible Chrome recovery — once cookies are cached in the profile, subsequent headless searches pass transparently.

### Visible Chrome Recovery

- **Mode-aware `ensureChrome()`** — `src/search/chrome.mjs` now reads a mode marker file (`greedysearch-chrome-mode`) written by `launch.mjs`. When `GREEDY_SEARCH_VISIBLE=1` and Chrome is running headless, it kills and relaunches in visible mode with a forced relaunch guard (always relaunches after kill, even if port wasn't freed).
- **`launch.mjs` mode check on reuse** — When Chrome is already running and visible is requested (`GREEDY_SEARCH_VISIBLE=1`), checks the mode file. If headless, kills the running instance and launches visible instead of reusing.
- **Mode file cleanup** — Mode marker file cleaned on `--kill`, ghost cleanup, and idle timeout kill.
- **`bin/launch-visible.mjs`** — Standalone visible Chrome launcher. Nukes any process on port 9222 (by PID file + port scan), launches Chrome without `--headless`, and writes `"visible"` to the mode file. No ghost cleanup complexity, no mode switching — fire-and-forget visible Chrome.
- **`bin/visible.mjs`** — Convenience wrapper: kills headless, then launches visible (delegates to `launch-visible.mjs`).
- **Progress notification** — When the auto-retry launches visible Chrome for manual Cloudflare verification, a `PROGRESS:bing:needs-human` line is emitted to stderr. The progress tracker renders `🔓 bing needs manual verification` in the Pi UI.
- **Idle cleanup preserves mode** — Headless idle timeout cleanup now also removes the mode marker file.

### Security & Robustness

- **Chrome process cleanup hardening** — `launch-visible.mjs` uses `taskkill /F /PID X /T` (process tree kill) on Windows to prevent orphan renderer processes. Repeated up to 5s until port 9222 is confirmed free.
- **Zombie Chrome prevention** — `launch.mjs` and `chrome.mjs` now clean up the mode marker and PID file consistently across all kill paths (--kill, ghost cleanup, idle timeout).

### Added

- **`google-search` engine** — plain Google search extractor (locale-agnostic, `textarea[name="q"]`). Returns title/URL/snippet for traditional 10-blue-link results. Aliases: `gs`, `googlesearch`.

### Headless Mode (default)

- **Chrome now runs headless by default** — no window, no GUI, purely background. Set `GREEDY_SEARCH_VISIBLE=1` to show the browser window.
- **Anti-detection stealth** — Patches injected via `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` (runs before any page JS):
  - `Runtime.enable` / CDP marker deletion (`__REBROWSER_*`, `__nightmare`, `__phantom`, etc.)
  - `navigator.webdriver` → `false`, `navigator.plugins` → realistic list, `navigator.languages` → `['en-US', 'en']`
  - `window.chrome` shim, WebGL vendor → Intel Iris, `hardwareConcurrency` → 8, `deviceMemory` → 8
  - `TrustedTypes` policy, `requestAnimationFrame` keep-alive (prevents headless stall detection)
  - `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`, realistic `--user-agent`, `--window-size=1920,1080`
- **Human click simulation** — All verification/clicks now use CDP `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` with multi-event `mouseMoved→pressed→released`, ±3px coordinate jitter, and random delays (80–180ms hover, 30–90ms hold). Detection scripts return element selectors instead of clicking in-page; `handleVerification` performs human clicks via `humanClickElement()`/`humanClickXY()`. Applies to Turnstile iframes, reCAPTCHA, Cloudflare challenges, Microsoft auth, Copilot modals, and all generic verify/continue buttons.
- **Idle auto-cleanup** — Headless Chrome auto-killed after `GREEDY_SEARCH_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` (default 5 min) of inactivity. Kills only the PID-tracked instance on port 9222 — never touches the main Chrome session. Activity timestamp written at search start and end.

### Performance

- **Timeouts cut ~40–50%** across all extractors — typical search ~60–90s → ~30–45s:
  - `TIMING`: postNav 1500→800ms, postNavSlow 2000→1000ms, postClick 400→250ms, postType 400→250ms, inputPoll 400→300ms, copyPoll 600→400ms, afterVerify 3000→2000ms
  - Defaults: waitForCopyButton 60s→30s, waitForStreamComplete 30s→20s, handleVerification 60s→30s
  - Per-extractor: Google stream 45s→30s, Gemini copyButton 120s→60s + inputDeadline 10s→8s, Perplexity inputDeadline 8s→5s + stream 30s→20s, Bing verification 90s→30s + copyButton 60s→30s
  - Engine process timeout: 90s→60s (180s→120s Gemini)

### Security

- **SonarCloud security hotspots fixed** — Two open hotspots resolved:
  - _Weak cryptography (S2245)_ in `extractors/consent.mjs`: replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomInt()` for the mouse-jitter RNG. Not actually security-sensitive (used only for ±3px jitter and timing delays), but compliant now.
  - _PATH injection (S4036)_ in `src/search/chrome.mjs`: `spawn("node", ...)` replaced with `spawn(process.execPath, ...)` so the launcher doesn't rely on the `PATH` environment variable.
- **Query/prompt leakage prevention** — Queries and synthesis prompts no longer appear in OS process tables. All `spawn()` calls now pipe query/prompt through stdin via `--stdin` flag instead of command-line arguments. Affects `runSearch`, `runExtractor`, `synthesizeWithGemini`, and all 5 extractors (`perplexity`, `bing-copilot`, `google-ai`, `google-search`, `gemini`).

### Visual

- **Redesigned banner** — Cleaner SVG layout with pi logo icon, no text, no lens graphic. Gemini Synthesizer pill badge integrated. Three design iterations landed on a minimal icon-only look (`docs/banner.svg`).

### Fixed

- **Gemini & Bing copy button race condition** — Both extractors were capturing the user's query instead of the AI's answer. Root cause: `document.querySelector()` returns the first copy button in DOM order, which is the user's echoed message (above the assistant's response). For short queries this triggers instantly. Fixed by: (1) replacing `waitForCopyButton` with `waitForStreamComplete` to ensure the response finishes streaming before copying, and (2) clicking the **last** copy button (`querySelectorAll` + `[length-1]`) instead of the first — matching Perplexity's proven pattern. Also added periodic scroll-to-bottom alongside stream wait for Gemini to trigger lazy-loaded content.
- **Progress tracker shows false ✅ for errors** — `makeProgressTracker` in `shared.ts` completely ignored the `status` parameter, always showing `✅ done` for every engine. Now correctly tracks per-engine status and shows `❌ failed` when an engine errors.
- **Synthesis echoes engine JSON when engines fail** — When Perplexity/Bing fail, Gemini was echoing the engine summary JSON back as its "answer". `synthesis-runner.mjs` now detects this pattern (engine keys without synthesis fields) and treats it as a parse failure, falling back to individual engine results.
- **`headless=false` parameter ignored** — The `--headless` flag was never checked by `search.mjs` or `launch.mjs`; they only read `GREEDY_SEARCH_VISIBLE`. `shared.ts` now propagates the visibility preference via the env var when `headless=false` is passed.

### Cloudflare / Verification Recovery

- **Auto-recovery from Cloudflare blocks** — When Perplexity (`#ask-input` not found) or Bing (`input not found` / `verification required`) fail in headless mode, `search.mjs` now:
  1. Detects the Cloudflare/verification error pattern
  2. Kills headless Chrome, relaunches in visible mode
  3. Retries the blocked engines — Cloudflare bypasses, cookies stored in Chrome profile
  4. Kills visible Chrome, relaunches headless
  5. Continues remaining pipeline (source fetch, synthesis)
  6. Cookies persist — subsequent headless searches pass transparently

### Removed

- **`coding_task` tool removed** — `bin/coding-task.mjs`, `src/formatters/coding.ts`, registration deleted (644 lines).
- **`deep_research` tool removed** — handler, test, and `formatDeepResearch` + helpers deleted (521 lines). Use `greedy_search` with `depth: "deep"`.
- **Minimize debug logs** — Removed 9 verbose `[minimize]` console.log statements from launch.mjs.

### Fixes

- **Code scanning alerts resolved (5 alerts)** — (1) Added `permissions: contents: read` to `sync-to-webaio.yml` workflow (#14). (2) Fixed backslash escaping in `consent.mjs`'s `humanClickElement` selector injection (#10) — selectors containing backslashes (e.g., `\"`) weren't properly escaped before DOM injection. (3) Fixed same backslash escaping in `google-search.mjs`'s `SEARCH_BOX` selector in 3 locations (#11-13).
- **`cdp.mjs` `getPages()` filter** — Allows `chrome://newtab/` (headless Chrome default initial tab). Prevents "No Chrome tabs found" on cold start.

### Security

- **SonarCloud: Log injection vulnerability (1 alert)** — `bin/launch.mjs` no longer logs the raw WebSocket debugger URL (user-controlled data). Replaced with a static "WebSocket URL received" message to prevent query/URL content from leaking into logs.

### Code Quality

- **SonarCloud batch fixes (~52 issues resolved)** across 16 source files:
  - `S7781` — Replaced 18 `String#replace()` calls with `String#replaceAll()` for global replacements (regex → literal where applicable).
  - `S1128` — Removed 15 unused imports (`dirname`, `join`, `relative`, `spawn`, `tmpdir`, `existsSync`, `shouldUseBrowser`, `closeTabs`, `cdp`, `openNewTab`, `closeTab`, `activateTab`, `trimText`).
  - `S7773` — Migrated 11 `parseInt`/`parseFloat` calls to `Number.parseInt`/`Number.parseFloat`.
  - `S7780` — Wrapped 8 CDP eval templates containing backslash sequences in `String.raw()` to eliminate double-escaping.
  - `S7735` — Eliminated 13 negated-condition ternaries by inverting the conditional logic (`!== -1 ? ... : null` → `=== -1 ? null : ...`).

### Security Hotspot Review

- **SonarCloud: 20 security hotspots reviewed and marked Safe** — All outstanding hotspots were assessed and resolved in SonarCloud:
  - `S4721` OS Command Injection (×2) — Inputs are hardcoded (`port=9222`) or parsed from system output and validated via `Number.parseInt`. Not user-controlled.
  - `S5852` Regex ReDoS (×10) — Regexes operate on bounded input with negated char classes or short fixed patterns. No practical denial-of-service risk.
  - `S4036` PATH environment variable (×8) — Local CLI extension spawning package-internal Node scripts. PATH is host-controlled; no untrusted input reaches the command.

### Tooling

- **SonarCloud configuration** — Added `sonar-project.properties` with exclusions for `test/**`, `test.mjs`, `test.sh`, `test_unit.mjs`, and `scripts/**` so test-only code does not skew source quality metrics.

## v1.8.5 (2026-04-29)

### Security

- **CodeQL: Incomplete URL substring sanitization (6 alerts)** — Replaced loose `includes()` / `endsWith()` checks on raw URL strings with proper hostname parsing in `src/github.mjs`, `src/reddit.mjs`, `src/fetcher.mjs`, and `extractors/bing-copilot.mjs`. Prevents bypasses where arbitrary subdomains could spoof trusted domains (e.g. `evilgithub.com`, `reddit.com.evil.com`).
- **CodeQL: Resource exhaustion (1 alert)** — `cdp loadall` now bounds `intervalMs` to 100–30,000ms to prevent unbounded `setTimeout` durations from untrusted CLI input.
- **CodeQL: Missing workflow permissions (2 alerts)** — Added explicit `permissions: contents: read` blocks to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/mirror-to-claude.yml`, limiting `GITHUB_TOKEN` scope to the minimum required.

### Dependencies

- **Dependabot security updates** — Bumped `basic-ftp`, `yaml`, `brace-expansion`, `protobufjs`, `fast-xml-parser`, and `@mozilla/readability` to latest patched versions.

### Tests

- **GitHub fetch test fixes** — Corrected ES module import paths and added `'all'` mode to test block conditions so cross-platform test runs pass cleanly.

## v1.8.4 (2026-04-27)

### Fixes

- **Double-escaped enum params (issue #2)** — `pi-coding-agent` v0.70.2 wraps string enum values in extra quotes (e.g. `"all"` → `"\"all\""`) before validation, causing `greedy_search`, `deep_research`, and `coding_task` to reject every call with a validation error. Fixed by switching `engine`, `depth`, and `mode` parameters from strict `Type.Union([Type.Literal(...)])` to `Type.String()` (so the call passes validation), then stripping the extra quotes in each handler via a shared `stripQuotes()` utility.

### Tests

- **Unit tests added** — `node test.mjs unit` runs 13 fast, Chrome-free tests covering `stripQuotes` and param normalization for all affected tools. Included in `quick` and `smoke` modes.
- **CI now runs unit tests** — GitHub Actions workflow runs `node test.mjs unit` after install on all three OS targets (ubuntu, windows, macos).

## v1.8.3 (2026-04-24)

### Fixes

- **Perplexity extraction fixed** — The copy button selector was returning the first matching button ("Copy question") instead of the answer copy button. Changed `.find()` to `.filter().pop()` to get the last matching button, which correctly copies the answer text. Fixes `--full` flag returning only the query text instead of the full answer.

### Features

- **Reddit JSON API support** — Reddit post URLs now use Reddit's public `.json` API instead of HTML scraping. Gets structured post data + top comments with nesting. Falls back to HTTP fetch if API fails.

## v1.8.2 (2026-04-20)

### Cross-Platform Testing

- **Node.js test runner (`test.mjs`)** — Added cross-platform test runner that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without requiring bash. Runs smoke tests, quick tests, and edge case tests.
- **Updated npm scripts** — `npm test` now runs the Node.js test runner (was bash-only). Original bash tests available via `npm run test:bash`.

### Project Metadata

- **Added `engines` field** — Package now specifies `node: ">=20.11.0"` requirement for `import.meta.dirname` support.
- **Updated README** — Added Testing section documenting both Node.js and bash test runners, clarified Node.js 20.11.0+ requirement.

## v1.8.0 (2026-04-16)

### Fixes

- **`cdpAvailable()` missing `baseDir` argument** — two callsites in `index.ts` (session_start handler and coding_task handler) were calling `cdpAvailable()` without the required `baseDir` parameter, producing an incorrect path (`join(undefined, "bin", "cdp.mjs")`). Both now pass `__dir` so the CDP check resolves against the correct package directory.
- **Duplicated `ENGINES` map removed** — `ENGINES` was defined identically in both `src/search/constants.mjs` and `src/search/engines.mjs`. Now `engines.mjs` imports and re-exports from `constants.mjs`, keeping a single canonical source and eliminating sync drift risk.
- **`ALL_ENGINES` sync comment** — added a `// Keep in sync with src/search/constants.mjs` comment on the `ALL_ENGINES` tuple in `shared.ts` so future maintainers know where the canonical definition lives.

## v1.7.7 (2026-04-14)

### Fixes

- **`--deep` flag leaking into queries** — `depth: "deep"` was passing `--deep` as a bare flag to `search.mjs`, which didn't recognize it and appended it to the query string. Fixed by passing `--depth deep` instead; also added `--deep` as a recognized flag in `search.mjs` for backward compatibility with the legacy `deep_research` tool.
- **GitHub fetch always failing** — `git clone` was being `await`-ed on a non-Promise `ChildProcess` object (Node `execFile` is callback-based), so the clone never actually completed and content was always empty. Replaced git clone entirely with GitHub REST API calls: repo info + README + file tree fetched via parallel HTTP requests (~2-5s vs 30-60s, no git dependency). Non-existent repos now correctly return `ok: false`.
- **`--inline` test false negative** — smoke test was interpolating multiline JSON stdout into a `node -e` string, always producing `PARSE_ERROR`. Fixed to write stdout to a temp file and parse from file.

### Features

- **Rich source metadata** — HTTP-fetched sources now include `publishedTime`, `lastModified`, `byline`, `siteName`, and `lang`. `publishedTime` is extracted from Readability's parser plus a fallback chain of 8 `<meta>` selectors (Open Graph, schema.org, Dublin Core). All fields flow through to the Gemini synthesis prompt. Gemini is instructed to flag sources older than 2 years as potentially stale in caveats.
- **GitHub Fetch Tests** — smoke/edge/quick test modes now include 4 GitHub-specific tests: root repo API fetch (README + tree), blob file via raw URL, blob via HTTP fetcher pipeline, and graceful failure on non-existent repo.

## v1.7.6 (2026-04-11)

### Fixes

- **Close Gemini synthesis tab** — after synthesis completes, the Gemini tab is now closed instead of merely activated, preventing stale tabs from accumulating across searches.

## v1.7.5 (2026-04-10)

### Plugin

- **Claude Code plugin** — added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` so GreedySearch can be installed directly as a Claude Code plugin via `claude plugin install`.
- **Auto-mirror GH Action** — every push to `GreedySearch-pi/master` automatically syncs to `GreedySearch-claude/main`, keeping the Claude plugin up to date.
- **Tightened `skill.md`** — removed verbose guidance sections; kept parameters, depth table, and coding_task reference. -72 lines.

## v1.7.4 (2026-04-10)

### Refactor

- **Shared `waitForCopyButton()`** — consolidated duplicate copy-button polling loops from `bing-copilot`, `gemini`, and `coding-task` into a single `waitForCopyButton(tab, selector, { timeout, onPoll })` in `common.mjs`. Gemini's scroll-to-bottom logic passed as `onPoll` callback.
- **Shared `TIMING` constants** — replaced 30+ scattered `setTimeout` magic numbers with named constants (`postNav`, `postNavSlow`, `postClick`, `postType`, `inputPoll`, `copyPoll`, `afterVerify`) in `common.mjs`.
- **`waitForStreamComplete` improvements** — added `minLength` option and graceful last-value fallback; `google-ai` now uses the shared implementation instead of its own copy.
- **Removed dead code** — deleted unused `_getOrReuseBlankTab` and `_getOrOpenEngineTab` from `bin/search.mjs`; removed unused `STREAM_POLL_INTERVAL` and `STREAM_STABLE_ROUNDS` from `coding-task`.

### Fixes

- **Synthesis tab regression** — `getOrOpenEngineTab("gemini")` call during synthesis was broken by the dead-code removal; replaced with `openNewTab()`.

## v1.7.3 (2026-04-10)

### Fixes

- **Force English in Google AI results** — Added `hl=en` query parameter to Google AI Mode search URL so responses are always returned in English, regardless of the user's IP-based region (fixes #1).

## v1.7.2 (2026-04-08)

### Release

- **Patch release** — version bump and npm package verification for the `bin/` runtime layout (`bin/search.mjs`, `bin/launch.mjs`, `bin/cdp.mjs`, `bin/coding-task.mjs`).

## v1.7.1 (2026-04-08)

### Performance

- **Bounded source-fetch concurrency** — source fetching now uses a small worker pool (default `2`, configurable via `GREEDY_FETCH_CONCURRENCY`) to reduce burstiness while keeping deep-research fast.

### Project structure

- **Runtime scripts moved to `bin/`** — `search.mjs`, `launch.mjs`, `cdp.mjs`, and `coding-task.mjs` now live under `bin/` for a cleaner repository root.
- **Path references updated** — extension runtime, tests, extractor shared utilities, and docs now point to `bin/*` paths.

### Packaging & docs

- **Package file list updated** — npm package now includes `bin/` directly instead of root script entries.
- **README simplified** — rewritten into a shorter, concise format with quick install, usage, and layout guidance.

## v1.6.5 (2026-04-04)

### Security

- **Private URL blocking** — Added validation to block requests to localhost, RFC1918 private addresses (10.x, 192.168.x), and .local/.internal domains. Prevents accidental exposure of internal services.

### Features

- **GitHub URL rewriting** — GitHub blob URLs (`github.com/owner/repo/blob/...`) are automatically rewritten to `raw.githubusercontent.com` for faster, cleaner raw file access.
- **GitHub repo cloning** — Root and tree URLs now trigger `git clone --depth 1` for complete repo access. Agent can explore files locally instead of parsing rendered HTML. Includes README preview and directory tree listing.
- **Head+tail content trimming** — Large documents now use smart truncation: keeps 75% from the beginning (introduction) + 25% from the end (conclusions/examples) with `[...content trimmed...]` marker, instead of simple truncation.
- **Anubis bot detection** — Added detection for the new Anubis proof-of-work anti-bot system (`protected by anubis`, `anubis uses a proof-of-work`).

### Fixes

- **Perplexity clipboard retry** — Added single retry with 2s delay when clipboard extraction fails, improving reliability.

## v1.6.4 (2026-04-02)

### Fixes

- **Gemini scroll-to-bottom** — Changed from small random jitter scrolls to actual bottom-of-page scrolls every ~6 seconds while waiting for the copy button. This ensures lazy-loaded content is triggered and the full answer is captured.
- **Restored missing files** — `.mjs` source files (extractors, search.mjs, launch.mjs, etc.) were incorrectly removed in v1.6.2 cleanup; now properly tracked again.

## v1.6.3 (2026-04-02)

### Fixes

- **Debug output removed** — Cleaned up stderr passthrough that was causing CDP connection issues in some environments.

## v1.6.2 (2026-04-01)

### Fixes

- **Anti-bot detection evasion** — Gemini synthesis now performs gentle scroll every ~6 seconds while waiting for the copy button. This prevents the button from hanging due to anti-bot "human activity" checks.

## v1.6.1 (2026-03-31)

### Features

- **Single-engine full answers by default** — when using `engine: "perplexity"`, `engine: "bing"`, `engine: "google"`, or `engine: "gemini"`, the full answer is now returned by default instead of truncated previews. Multi-engine (`engine: "all"`) still uses truncated previews (~300 chars) to save tokens during synthesis. Explicit `fullAnswer: true/false` always overrides.

### Code Quality

- **Major refactoring** — extracted 438 lines from `index.ts` (856 → 418 lines) into modular formatters:
  - `src/formatters/coding.ts` — coding task formatting
  - `src/formatters/results.ts` — search and deep research formatting
  - `src/formatters/sources.ts` — source utilities (URL, label, consensus, formatting)
  - `src/formatters/synthesis.ts` — synthesis rendering
  - `src/utils/helpers.ts` — shared formatting utilities
- **Complexity reduced** — cognitive complexity dropped from 360 to ~60, maintainability index improved from 11.2 to ~40+
- **Eliminated code duplication** — removed 6 duplicate blocks, consolidated 4+ single-use helper functions

### Documentation

- Clarified `greedy_search` is WEB SEARCH ONLY — removed "NOT for codebase search" from tool description (still in skill documentation)

## v1.6.0 (2026-03-29)

### Breaking Changes (Backward Compatible)

- **Merged deep_research into greedy_search** — new `depth` parameter with three levels:
  - `fast`: single engine (~15-30s)
  - `standard`: 3 engines + synthesis (~30-90s, default for `engine: "all"`)
  - `deep`: 3 engines + source fetching + synthesis + confidence (~60-180s)
- **Simpler mental model** — one tool with clear speed/quality tradeoffs instead of separate tools with overlapping flags
- **Deprecated flags still work** — `--synthesize` maps to `depth: "standard"`, `--deep-research` maps to `depth: "deep"`
- **deep_research tool aliased** — still works, calls `greedy_search` with `depth: "deep"`

### Documentation

- Updated README with new `depth` parameter and examples
- Updated skill documentation (SKILL.md) to reflect simplified API

## v1.5.1 (2026-03-29)

- **Fixed npm package** — added `.pi-lens/` and test files to `.npmignore` to reduce package size

## v1.5.0 (2026-03-29)

### Features

- **Code extraction fixed** — `coding_task` now uses clipboard interception to preserve markdown code blocks (was losing them via DOM scraping)
- **Chrome targeting hardened** — all tools now consistently target the dedicated GreedySearch Chrome via `CDP_PROFILE_DIR`, preventing fallback to user's main Chrome session
- **Shared utilities** — extracted ~220 lines of duplicate code from extractors into `common.mjs` (cdp wrapper, tab management, clipboard interception)
- **Documentation leaner** — skill documentation reduced 61% (180 → 70 lines) while preserving all decision-making info

### Notable

- **NO API KEYS** — updated messaging to emphasize this works via browser automation, no API keys needed

## v1.4.2 (2026-03-25)

- **Fresh isolated tabs** — each search now always creates a new `about:blank` tab via `Target.createTarget` and refreshes the CDP page cache immediately after, preventing SPA navigation failures and stale DOM state from prior queries
- **Regex-based citation extraction** — all extractors (Perplexity, Bing, Gemini) now parse sources from clipboard Markdown links (`[title](url)`) instead of DOM selectors that break on UI updates
- **Relaxed verification detection** — `consent.mjs` now uses broad keyword matching (`includes('verify')`, `includes('human')`) instead of anchored regexes, correctly catching button text variants like "Verify you are human" across Cloudflare, Microsoft, and generic modals

## v1.4.1

- **Fixed parallel synthesis** — multiple `greedy_search` calls with `synthesize: true` now run safely in parallel. Each search creates a fresh Gemini tab that gets cleaned up after synthesis, preventing tab conflicts and "Uncaught" errors.

## v1.4.0

- **Grounded synthesis** — Gemini now receives a normalized source registry with stable source IDs, agreement summaries, caveats, and cited claims
- **Real deep research** — top sources are fetched before synthesis so deep research answers are grounded in fetched evidence, not just engine summaries
- **Richer source metadata** — source output now includes canonical URLs, domains, source types, per-engine attribution, and confidence metadata
- **Cleaner tab lifecycle** — temporary Perplexity, Bing, and Google tabs are closed after each fan-out search, and synthesis finishes on the Gemini tab
- **Isolated Chrome targeting** — GreedySearch now refuses to fall back to your normal Chrome session, preventing stray remote-debugging prompts
