 * Warm side-channel for the push path. The MCP server is a long-lived process
 * with a warm LSP, but its stdio is owned by the MCP client — so the
 * PostToolUse-hook bin can't reach it that way. Instead the server listens on a
 * local IPC endpoint (Unix domain socket / Windows named pipe), and the hook
 * connects to it to get LSP-complete diagnostics from the warm process instead
 * of running its own cold analysis.
 *
 * This module is the CLIENT + the shared path derivation only — deliberately
 * light (node:net + type-only result), so the bin can try the warm path WITHOUT
 * loading the dispatch graph. The server side lives in mcp/server.ts (which
 * already holds the analysis engine). If the warm path is unavailable, the
 * client resolves `undefined` and the caller falls back to cold local analysis.
